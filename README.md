## Project Overview:

For the **Neighborhood Map Project** I built a single page application featuring a map of sushi restaurant locations in Frederick, MD, the city where I live. I added functionality to this map including info windows, custom markers, a side bar list of the restaurants and search filtering of the restaurant list with associated markers filtered synchrnously on the map.

##Specification

The goal of this project was to build a single page map application using React & Google Maps API, plus to integrate a third-party data API, in this case Foursquare, and make the app accessible and usable offline.
